* Basic Content Types

  * post

    * Threads where the first post is a post rather than a link or
      special content type.

  * micro

    * Threads where there is no first post, only a title.

  * link

    * Links to an external site that is not a picture or video link.

  * blog

    * Thread that is like a post, but with comments hidden by default
      like a wiki. Restricted to certain users or locations, and
      handled specially in the indexes.

* Advanced Content Types

  * pic

    * Links to externally hosted pictures (and eventually uploaded
      pictures).

  * video

    * Links to externally hosted videos.

  * wiki

    * Collaborative editing of the first post, with public history
      available on that post.

    * Ability to include content from other sections in some sort of
      quote-like system.

    * URL contains the title, which must be unique, rather than a
      hexadecimal number.

    * Comments 'hidden' at first and must be clicked to be shown???

* Special Content Types

  * data

    * Machine-generated, human-readable content.

  * mail

    * Can handle private messaging and (eventually) email.

    * Private to the receiver instead of public to all.

  * profile

    * User profile, with information for the user, both info publicly
      visible and private to only user (and/or admins?).

    * Allow for customization of the material presented, e.g. to allow
      for "blogging" with content shown under profile/foo/blog that
      doubles as a post-type content visible elsewhere?

    * Show post/submission history?

* Permissions and Accounts

* Tagging

  * public (global, multi-tag)

  * private (visible only you, such as tagging users or posts with a
    certain label)

  * Tags allow 'inheritance' from parent tags, so if tagged as a child
    tag it is automatically tagged as its parent tag(s) as well.

  * User tag display structure:

     username [Real Name] [Public (Forum) Tag] [Private (User) Tag] [Admin/Mod Indicator]

  * Post tag display structure:

     Content Type [Special (Restricted) Tags] ... [Regular (Forum) Tags] ... [Private (User) Tag] [Admin/Mod Indicator]

* Forum Types

  * public

  * open only to members

* Repost Interface

  * After three months, the ability is given to repost something
    already posted (if not wiki). The first/top reply in this case is
    a special meta post that links to previous discussions.

* Forums

  * Independently run sections of the site with global moderators and
    moderators for various content or tag types.

* Tagging

  * public (global, multi-tag)

  * private (visible only you, such as tagging users or posts with a
    certain label)

  * Tags allow 'inheritance' from parent tags, so if tagged as a child
    tag it is automatically tagged as its parent tag(s) as well.

  * User tag display structure:

     username [Real Name] [Public (Forum) Tag] [Private (User) Tag] [Admin/Mod Indicator]

  * Post tag display structure:

     Content Type [Special (Restricted) Tags] ... [Regular (Forum) Tags] ... [Private (User) Tag] [Admin/Mod Indicator]

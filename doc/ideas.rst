Later Ideas
-----------

* Tagging

  * public (global, multi-tag)

  * private (visible only you, such as tagging users or posts with a
    certain label)

  * Tags allow 'inheritance' from parent tags, so if tagged as a child
    tag it is automatically tagged as its parent tag(s) as well.

  * User tag display structure:

     username [Real Name] [Public (Forum) Tag] [Private (User) Tag] [Admin/Mod Indicator]

  * Post tag display structure:

     Content Type [Special (Restricted) Tags] ... [Regular (Forum) Tags] ... [Private (User) Tag] [Admin/Mod Indicator]

* Forum Types

  * public

  * open only to members

* Repost Interface

  * After three months, the ability is given to repost something
    already posted (if not wiki). The first/top reply in this case is
    a special meta post that links to previous discussions.

* Forums

  * Independently run sections of the site with global moderators and
    moderators for various content or tag types.

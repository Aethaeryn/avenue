Avenue
======

Avenue simplifies system administration by providing minimalist
content systems that integrate seamlessly into one Python web
application with one database. No content mode is more privileged than
another. This allows one application that can handle multiple content
roles, instead of having to run separate software for forums, wikis,
blogging, and so on.

This enables one website to have a shared theme and a unified account
system. You don't have to worry about getting different apps, intended
for different purposes, to talk to each other. There's a consistent
user interface, too.

Avenue is also designed to be extendable. Future plug-ins will include
browser-based HTML 5 games, web email, and possibly even IRC clients!

Avenue is convergence for web apps. Why handle text a dozen different
ways if you don't have to?

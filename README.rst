Avenue
======

Avenue is a new way to run a website. Don't run many independent web
applications that are designed for their own, isolated ecosystems!
Avenue makes your life simple by providing minimalist content systems
that integrate seamlessly into one Python web application with one
database. No content mode is more privileged than another. With
Avenue, you're not forced to use an application for something that
it's not designed for. You don't get a good user experience if you try
to discuss in a wiki application or blog in a forum application.

Everything fits together in one website with a shared theme set and a
unified account system. The entire site just works out of the box
without having to hand-modify or install any plugins to get different
apps, intended for different purposes, to talk to each other. There's
a consistent user interface, too. Of course, if you want to extend
Avenue, it is designed to handle that. It should be able to support
browser-based HTML 5 games, web email, and possibly even IRC clients!

Avenue is convergence for web apps. Why handle text a dozen different
ways if you don't have to?

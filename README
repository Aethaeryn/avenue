Avenue provides a minimalist content system for forums, wikis,
blogging, and so on. This enables one website to have a shared theme
and a unified account system. You don't have to worry about getting
different apps, intended for different purposes, to talk to each
other. There's a consistent user interface, too.

Avenue is convergence for web apps. Why handle text many different
ways if you don't have to?
